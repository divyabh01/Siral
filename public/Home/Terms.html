                <h4 class="lead" id="seven">7. Warranty</h4>
                <p>7.1 "Non-conformance" means failure to comply with warranty, as defined below, within the Warranty Period.</p>
                <p>7.2 Normal wear and tear, regular overhaul, and periodic maintenance do not constitute non-conformance.</p>
                <p>7.3 Seller warrants that its Products shall conform to the description of such Products as provided to Buyer by Seller through Seller's Product literature. This warranty is exclusive, and Seller makes no other warranty, express or implied, including any implied warranty or merchantability or fitness for any particular purpose or course of dealing or usage of trade, which are hereby disclaimed. Seller’s warranties made in connection of a sale shall not be effective if Seller has determined, in its sole discretion, that Buyer has misused the Products in any manner depicting non-conformance, has failed to use the Products in accordance with industry standards and practices, or has failed to use the Products in accordance with instructions, if any, furnished by Seller. Seller does not warrant any Products obtained through an unauthorized Distributor, Dealer, or Agent.</p>
                <p>7.4 The “Warranty Period” for all Products listed in Seller’s Product literature shall carry a five (5) year warranty within the United States. The 5 year warranty period is unconditional for the first two (2) years from the date of production of Products. After the first 2 years from the date of sale, the warranty shall be conditional and the warranty coverage shall not apply to damage to Products caused by factors that constitute non-conformance beyond the control of Seller. The period shall begin on the later of (a) the date on which the Product first enters a retail distribution/sales channel, or (b) the date of delivery to the end user provided Buyer presents the end user’s retail invoice demonstrating such date of delivery. </p>
                <p>7.5 Seller warrants to Buyer that at the time of shipment and for the Warranty Period: (a) the Product will be free from defects in workmanship and materials, and (b) the Product will  comply  with  the  drawings,  specifications,  and  operating  conditions  as set  forth in Seller’s instructions, manuals, or specifications.</p>
                <p>7.6 This Warranty does not apply to prototype, development, and pre-production Products. All prototype, development, and pre-production Products are accepted by Buyer on an “AS IS” basis with no warranties whatsoever. Furthermore, Seller shall not be responsible for any non-conformance if the Product has been exposed or subjected to any: (a) use of the Product other than specified in applicable Seller’s instructions, manuals, or specifications; or (b) operation of Product outside of operating limits and parameters; or (c) maintenance, repair, overhaul, installation, storage, operation or use, which is improper or not in accordance with Seller’s instructions, manuals, or specifications; or (d) alteration, modification, including by integration of Products into or with Buyer’s equipment, or (e) accident, contamination, foreign object damage, abuse, neglect or negligence after shipment to Buyer; or (f) use of counterfeit or replacement parts that are not manufactured or approved by Seller for use in  Seller’s manufactured Products; or (g) damage caused by failure of any hardware or software  not supplied by Seller or a Seller supplied Product not under warranty.</p>
                <p>7.7 Buyer must notify Seller of any claimed non-conformance in writing by returning a Returned Material Authorization Form (“RMA Form”) to Seller.</p>
                <p>7.8 Prior to returning any Products under warranty, Buyer must obtain an RMA number from Seller. The RMA  Form  must  be  received  by  Seller within ninety (90) days of Buyer’s discovery of any claimed non-conformance and must contain a detailed description of any  claimed non-conformance  or Buyer will be barred from any remedy under the Warranty. </p>
                <p>7.9 Upon  Seller’s  receipt  of  Buyer’s  completed  RMA  Form, Seller  will  provide  Buyer  with  a  Returned  Material  Authorization Number (“RMA#”). Buyer must await its receipt of the RMA# before returning any Product to Seller. </p>
                <p>7.10 Seller will return, at Buyer’s expense, any  Product  not  properly  identified  or  associated  with  an RMA#. When Seller requires the examination of claimed non-conforming Product, Seller will notify Buyer as to the place of return and will await receipt of the claimed non-conforming Product before further processing the warranty claim.</p>
                <p>7.11 Buyer will ship the Product by normal ground shipment and bear the cost of shipment and risk of loss or damage to Products while in transit to Seller.</p>
                <p>7.12 If Seller ultimately determines that the failed part is covered under Warranty, Shipper will reimburse Buyer for the cost of ground shipment for the Product(s) found to be in non-conformance.</p>
                <p>7.13 If Seller reasonably determines after analysis of the returned Product that a non-conformance does not exist, then Buyer will pay all expenses related to the improper return  including, but not limited to, analysis and shipping charges. </p>
                <p>7.14 Any claimed non-conforming Product must be received by Seller within thirty (30) days of issuance of a notice to return Product.</p>
                <p>7.15 If Seller determines that a Product does not conform to Warranty, Seller may elect, in its sole discretion, to repair, replace, or exchange the Product, or credit the original purchase price. In addition, Seller will credit Buyer for standard labor and handling costs (to be agreed case by case) per applicable Product.</p>
                <p>7.16 Repair, replacement, exchange, or credit of the original purchase price and standard labor and handling costs are the exclusive remedies under Seller’s Warranty. All Products repaired, replaced or exchanged are warranted for a period equal to the greater of: (a) the remainder of the original 5 year Warranty Period or 2 year Warrant that was applicable to the repaired, replaced or exchanged Products, or six (6) months, effective from the date the repaired, replaced or exchanged Products are shipped by Seller.</p>
                <hr class="featurette-divider">
                <h4 class="lead" id="eight">8. Limitation of Liability </h4>
                <p>8.1 In no event will Seller be liable for any incidental damages, consequential damages, special damages, punitive damages, statutory damages, indirect damages, loss of shipment, loss of products, loss of profits, loss of revenues, loss of use or damage to brand name, even if informed of the possibility of such damages. Seller’s liability for damages arising out of or related to this agreement shall in no case exceed in the aggregate a sum equal to twice the amount actually paid to Seller for the products from which the claim arose. Further, if buyer requires Seller to use a particular supplier or suppliers, then Seller shall have no liability for the supplier(s) performance, nor for any damages caused directly or indirectly by Seller’s product to the extent resulting from incorporation of such supplier(s) product. To the extent permitted by applicable law, these limitations and exclusions will apply regardless of whether liability arises from breach of contract, warranty, tort (including but not limited to negligence), by operation of law, or otherwise. Nothing herein, however, is intended to disclaim Seller’s liability for personal injury or death caused by defective products to the extent such liability is mandated by law. </p>
                <hr class="featurette-divider">
                <h4 class="lead" id="nine">9. Place of Jurisdiction and Applicable Law</h4>
                <p>9.1 The exclusive place of jurisdiction for all disputes arising from these Terms between the parties shall be governed by the laws of the State of Maryland and the parties shall be governed exclusively by the formal and material laws of the Federal and state courts located in the State of Maryland without reference to its conflict of law provisions. All disputes arising hereunder or in connection with Products shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Maryland, to which the parties hereby submit themselves. </p>
